    <h1>Discover the World of Dinosaurs</h1>
    <p>
      Dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years, long before humans appeared.
      They were a diverse group of reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era, often called
      the “Age of Dinosaurs,” which was divided into three periods: the Triassic, Jurassic,
      and Cretaceous.

      <h2>🦕 Herbivorous Dinosaurs</h2>
      <p>
        Herbivores were plant-eating dinosaurs. Many had long necks to reach tall trees,
        or beaks for clipping tough vegetation. Some of the most famous herbivores include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brachiosaurus</strong> – A massive dinosaur with a long neck, capable of eating leaves high in the trees.</li>
        <li><strong>Triceratops</strong> – Known for its three horns and large frill used for defense and display.</li>
        <li><strong>Stegosaurus</strong> – Famous for the row of plates on its back and its spiked tail.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🦖 Carnivorous Dinosaurs</h2>
      <p>
        Carnivores were meat-eating predators that hunted other dinosaurs or scavenged for food.
        They often had sharp teeth and powerful jaws. Famous carnivores include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tyrannosaurus Rex</strong> – One of the largest land predators, with massive jaws and bone-crushing teeth.</li>
        <li><strong>Velociraptor</strong> – A smaller but intelligent and fast predator, often hunting in packs.</li>
        <li><strong>Allosaurus</strong> – A fierce hunter that lived during the Jurassic period.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>💥 The Extinction Event</h2>
      <p>
        Around 66 million years ago, a massive asteroid impact caused drastic climate changes,
        leading to the extinction of most dinosaurs. Only birds — which evolved from small
        theropod dinosaurs — survived, making them the last living dinosaurs on Earth today.
